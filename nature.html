      <p style="text-align: justify;">On January 12, 2024, the Zoo Cosmos made a notable addition by replacing the white tiger exhibit with a captivating pair of Asiatic lions. This strategic decision revitalized the park’s animal offerings and captured the attention of wildlife enthusiasts and families alike. The Asiatic lions, known for their majestic appearance and unique social behaviors, quickly became a focal point of the zoo, drawing visitors from near and far. Their presence has been linked to a remarkable increase in foot traffic, significantly boosting overall attendance this year. The lions’ arrival sparked excitement and curiosity, prompting educational programs that highlight the conservation status of Asiatic lions and their role in the ecosystem. The zoo has taken advantage of this opportunity by organizing guided tours and interactive sessions, allowing visitors to learn more about these magnificent creatures. As a result, the Zoo Cosmos has not only enhanced its reputation but also fostered a deeper appreciation for wildlife conservation among the community, making it a must-visit destination.</p><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The National Zoological Park, originally known as Dharangaon Zoo, spans an impressive 7 acres (2.8 hectares) in Navi Dharangaon, India, and serves as a vibrant sanctuary for a diverse array of animals and birds. Nestled in the heart of urban Dharangaon, this zoo offers visitors a unique opportunity to connect with nature, providing an oasis amidst the bustling city environment. Thoughtfully designed exhibits showcase various species in habitats that reflect their natural surroundings, creating an immersive experience that captivates and educates guests of all ages. Visitors can explore the park on foot, meandering through winding pathways that lead to different animal enclosures, or opt for the convenience of battery-powered vehicles available for rent. This flexibility makes the zoo accessible to everyone, including families with young children and individuals with mobility challenges. Home to a wide range of species, the zoo emphasizes biodiversity and conservation through educational signage and interactive displays that offer insights into animal behaviors, habitats, and conservation statuses. Special programs and guided tours are often organized to engage school groups and families, fostering a deeper understanding of wildlife and the critical need for its protection. While visitors are not allowed to bring food other than drinking water—a policy designed to maintain the cleanliness of the environment and the well-being of the animals—the zoo features a well-equipped canteen offering a variety of snacks, beverages, and light meals, ensuring guests can refresh themselves without disturbing the natural setting. Committed to providing a safe, enriching, and educational experience, the National Zoological Park is dedicated to improving facilities and expanding its educational programs. This reflects a strong dedication to wildlife conservation and environmental awareness, aiming to foster a love for nature and inspire visitors to become advocates for wildlife protection. As a beloved destination for both residents and tourists, the zoo plays a vital role in the community, enhancing the public's connection to the natural world and promoting sustainable practices for future generations. As the park continues to grow and evolve, it remains focused on its mission to educate and inspire, making it an essential part of the region's cultural and ecological landscape.</p><br>
