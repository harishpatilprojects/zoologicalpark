      <p style="text-align: justify;">On April 13, 2023, the Dharangaon Municipal Corporation officially inaugurated the Zoo Cosmos, transforming a private menagerie established by <b>Mr. Harish Patil</b> in 2019 into a public facility. Spanning approximately 7 acres (2.8 hectares), the park is strategically located in the heart of the city, nestled at the base of the picturesque Zoo Cosmos Hill. This unique setting not only provides a natural backdrop but also enhances the visitor experience by integrating the zoo into the surrounding landscape. The Zoo Cosmos showcases a diverse array of animal species, housed in open forest-style enclosures that mimic their natural habitats, allowing for a more immersive experience for both animals and visitors. The park aims to promote conservation and education, offering a platform for wildlife enthusiasts, families, and school groups to learn about various species and the importance of biodiversity. With plans for educational programs, guided tours, and interactive exhibits, the zoo is poised to become a vital center for wildlife conservation and awareness in the region. As it continues to develop, the Zoo Cosmos represents a commitment to preserving wildlife and fostering a deeper appreciation for nature among the community. Its establishment marks a significant step forward in promoting eco-tourism and enhancing the cultural landscape of Dharangaon, making it a must-visit destination for residents and tourists alike.</p><br>
    
      <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, <b>Mr. Harish Patil</b> in the inaugural director of the Zoo Cosmos, collaborated closely with the Dharangaon Municipal Corporation to establish the Katraj Snake Park on the land designated for what would eventually become the larger zoological park. Recognizing the importance of educating the public about reptiles and their ecological roles, Mr. Patil envisioned the Katraj Snake Park as a dedicated space where visitors could learn about various snake species, their habitats, and conservation efforts. The park features carefully designed enclosures that provide a safe environment for the snakes while allowing optimal visibility for guests. In addition to housing an array of native and exotic snake species, the Katraj Snake Park aims to dispel common myths and misconceptions about these often-misunderstood creatures. With interactive exhibits and educational programs tailored for schools and families, the park serves as an important resource for fostering awareness and appreciation of reptiles. Furthermore, the establishment of the Katraj Snake Park complements the broader mission of the PZoo Cosmos, which seeks to promote wildlife conservation and environmental education. By focusing on reptiles, the park addresses an essential aspect of biodiversity and underscores the interconnectedness of all species within their ecosystems. As it continues to grow, the Katraj Snake Park is set to become a key attraction, enriching the visitor experience and contributing significantly to local conservation efforts.</p><br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of creating the Zoo Cosmos was initially proposed by a group of passionate individual <b>Mr. Krushna Patil, Mr. Jayesh Patil, Mr. Manish Patil, Mr. Nikhil Patil, Mr. Bhushan Rajput, Mr. Shubham Chaudhari</b> as far back as 2012. This visionary team recognized the potential for a zoological park to serve not only as a recreational space but also as an important center for wildlife conservation and education within the community. Their enthusiasm for promoting biodiversity and fostering a love for nature sparked discussions and plans, but various challenges and bureaucratic hurdles delayed the project's approval. After years of advocacy and community engagement, the idea finally gained traction, and in 2019, the Dharangaon Municipal Corporation formally approved the development of the park. This pivotal moment marked a significant step toward realizing the vision that had been nurtured for nearly a decade. The commitment of the original proponents, coupled with support from local authorities, played a crucial role in bringing the project to fruition. Today, the Zoo Cosmos stands as a testament to their perseverance and dedication, providing a vibrant space for education, conservation, and community engagement, while inspiring future generations to appreciate and protect the natural world.</p><br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The park also incorporates a rescue centre for injured and orphaned animals. It has run an animal adoption scheme since 25th August 2023.</p><br>
